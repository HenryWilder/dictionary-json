# dictionary-json
A JSON containing arrays of all the words I could find, segmented by part of speech and sorted alphabetically. Might be useful for non-AI language models.

### Why does this exist?
I really dislike AI. It's too unpredictable and susceptable to bias.

Language is structured. It has rules and works sensibly.

There is no reason you should need an AI to write it when a good old rigid algorithm could do it with more tweakability and less nonsense.

Basically, I want to make a library of the English language for anyone making such a project.

I was honestly surprised by the lack of centralization and order for words. You can't just see a raw list of every word in Webster's dictionary with its part of speech, synonyms, antonyms, etc. You have to go word-by-word navigating to each page in the dictionary. It's weird.

Anyway, that's what this tries to be: all the ((American) English) words in a big JSON for language programs to fetch or embed.
